0.4, 0.6, 0.8  Wh difference per loop (0.6, 0.7, 0.8 for CD0 respectively)

Suggests small difference in energy consumption due to height strategy, and so only use height strategy if there is a high degree of certainty in the aerodynamic parameters

1s 0.7s 0.5s increase in lap time when removing height strategy for respective CD0 (0.6 0.7 0.8).

k=0.05 for all sims
